INTRODUCTION:

The scripts in this directory try to work according to the KISS principle. It 
contains a script which redirects its stdin to serial device 
(send_to_serial.py), one that simulates the ledbar and sends the data unaltered 
from its stdin to its stdout, a module that helps programmers to program 
various graphical effects and some example effect generators using this module.


EXAMPLES:

./rainbow.py | ./demo.py >/dev/null
    - only simulate the rainbow effect, do not send it anywhere

./rainbow.py | ./send_to_serial.py
    - only send the data to the serial device, do not show the simulation

./rainbow.py | ./demo.py | ./send_to_serial.py
    - combine both options, show a simulation and send the data to the serial
      device


DEPENDENCIES:

demo.py requires PyGame, Python wrapper around SDL
send_to_serial.py requires PySerial, Python library for work with serial ports
